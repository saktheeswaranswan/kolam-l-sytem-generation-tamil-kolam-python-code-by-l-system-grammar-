Traditional Indian Indoor Games
Traditional Indian indoor games usually require a lot of mental work and improve children’s problem-solving skills. Some of these games have also been adopted by the Western world, and now we know them by their more popular English names.

Pachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.

In both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.

This game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.

In the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.

You can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.

3. Ashtapada

Ashtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8×8 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.

Each player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.

Another variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10×10 board.

4. Chaturanga

Chaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.

Just like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces — the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.

The ultimate goal is to get the opponent’s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.

It is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.

In this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.

The starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent’s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.

The game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.

In this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.

6. Antakshari

The first player to reach the “highest heaven” is the winner.
