Traditional Childhood Games Of Andhra Pradesh
November 22, 2015
Children in general are fond of playing games accompanied with songs. There were many outdoor / indoor games played by the children in the olden days. Most of these childhood games are at the verge of fading away due to the dominance of e-games.


The childhood games that were played in the olden days were not just games for the sake of playing and enjoying but those were rich in physical and mental exercise and with moral / ethical values. Unfortunately, the present generation children are devoid of the enjoyment of those games. These children don't even know the names of many of these traditional childhood games.

An attempt for reviving the age old traditional games of Andhra Pradesh that are fading away. This is in view of letting the younger generations know about, at least, the names of these games and how these are / were played.
Age old traditional childhood games
Following are the names of some of the traditional Telugu games of Andhra Pradesh that have almost faded away:
Kaalla Gajja Kankaallamma
This game is mostly played by the girls. However little boys too join the group. The game can be played both indoors and outdoors. In this game all the girls gather around and sit with their legs spread out. One of the girls (eldest among all) sings this following Telugu rhyme in a rhythmic way and for each word of the song, she touches each of the leg that is spread by the children in line. Here goes the rhyme:

kaalla gajja kankaallamma
vaayakaadu kammari mettu
vegula chukka velagaa mogga
mettu kaadu medari jachchaa
mogga kaadu moduga neeru
jachcha kaadu jalaari katta
neeru kaadu nimmala vaaya
kaalu teesi kadagaa bettu

The game has its own health aspects. It helps in freely stretching of legs and helps in the strengthening of muscles.
Chamma Chekka Charadesi Mogga
This game is played indoors and outdoors as well by young girls. Two players can play this game. Both the players rhythmically clap their hands, then spread their palms to touch each other's palms and go round and round in circles with to and fro leg movement. The game keeps the children active by providing proper exercise to the body parts. They sing the following song in a rhythmic way while playing:

chamma chekka charadesi mogga
atlu poyanga aaraginchanga
mutyaala chamma chekka mugguleyanga
ratnaala chamma chekka ranguleyanga
pagadaala chamma chekka pandireyanga
pellamma pelli
subbaraidu pelli chusoddam randi
amma naaku buvva arachetilo gavva

The song / rhyme is sung in different versions in different regions of the state.

When its drizzle but not heavy rains, children go out and enjoy playing in the drizzle. They, just move round and round to themselves in circles with their hands stretched out and sing this song. When they get tired and their heads start reeling, they sit and rest for a while and again restore their play. They get back to their homes, when there is a heavy down pour.

This games helps in developing immunity in the children against seasonal colds.
Chekubuku railu
The game is played by tiny tots who form a train hold one another's back and run like a train singing this song:

chekubuku railu vastondi
pakkaku pakkaku tappukondi
jojo papa yedavaku
laddu mithai tinipistan
kammani paalu tagistan

The game helps in bringing awareness among the young ones on being careful at railway station and at the railway crossings.

Different version:

Daagudumootala dandakor
pilli vache yeluka daate
ekkadidongalu akkadane
gapchip sambaaru buddi

This is one of favorite games of the children in those days. This is a hide and seek game. Any number of children both boys and girls can play the game. One child who is supposed to be out, is made blindfold and the others keep moving / running round the child, singing the song and touching the child. When the blindfold child holds a player, he / she is declared out and takes the place of the blindfold player.

The other way of playing the game is - one player who is out, closes his / her eyes and counts up to a specified number. The other players hide themselves behind the bushes or trees or other big objects. After the child finishes counting, he / she starts searching for the players and after finding them, shouts out their names. The first child to be found takes the turn. This game helps in improving the mind power of the child and his / her keen observation.

This game is mostly played by the boys and it requires at least four pillars. Boys run around and touch and hug the pillars. The one who is left out without a pillar is out. The game resembles musical chairs.
Chedugudu
This game is nothing by Kabaddi played by the village lads. This is an outdoor game and requires two teams each team with 10 players. A line is drawn between the two playing teams and a player from each team crosses the line, gets into the other team saying the words 'chedugu chedugu' holding his breath. The players tries to touches the players of the rival team. If he touches and returns to his team, then the other player is declared out. In case, the rival team players encircle the player, holds him and stops him from touching / crossing the line, then the player is declared out. On the other hand, if the player succeeds in touching the line, then all the players who hold the player are declared out.
Uppu basta
This outdoor game is mostly played by boys. Two boys form a team and there can be 5-6 such participant teams. The older boy in each team carries the younger one on his shoulders and run from a starting point to ending point. This is like a running race which helps in the physical growth of young boys.

There was a healthy growth of the body and mind of the children without stress and tensions. Unfortunately, most of these traditional games are at the verge of fading away. It would be really nice if at least these are passed on to the next next generations who have neither have any idea of these games nor have heard of these.
