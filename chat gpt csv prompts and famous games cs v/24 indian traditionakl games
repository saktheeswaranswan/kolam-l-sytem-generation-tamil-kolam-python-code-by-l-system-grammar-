Sports and games have always been an integral part of India’s rich culture and history. Sadly, today’s kids are so engrossed in playing video games that traditional games like Pallanguzi, Lippa, Kabaddi, Gilli-danda have been completely forgotten. Gone are the days when kids simply couldn’t wait to go out and play a few rounds of Pithoo or Kith-Kith (Hopscotch) with their friends.

In this article, we will discuss both indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games. This will hopefully encourage little ones to play traditional games of India more often and keep traditions passing down from generation to generation.
