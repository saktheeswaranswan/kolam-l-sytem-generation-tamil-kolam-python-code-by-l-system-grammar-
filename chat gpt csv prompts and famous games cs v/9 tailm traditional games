9 Indian traditional games for children
What's common between the terms Pagade, Nondi, Pallanguzhi, Lippa and Satoliya? Here's a clue - they are an integral part of Indian culture and have been around for centuries.

Confused? They are traditional games that have been played since time immemorial in India. However, with the advent of video games and gadgets, people, especially the younger generations, have forgotten these games. We take a closer look at some of them to revive fond memories and give our children a glimpse of the past.

Gilli Danda or Lippa, considered to be the origin of cricket, is a game played with two pegs - the longer one is called danda and the shorter, gilli. A player uses the danda to hit the gilli, and when the gilli rises in the air, the player must strike it with the danda.

Nondi was a game played by girls in the rural villages of Tamil Nadu. This game of hopping requires a player to capture the maximum number of squares in a grid, without his feet touching the border lines.

Indian Traditional Games states that kabaddi, an ancient game of India, is still very popular. A team sport, kabaddi requires strength and agility, and no equipment. Bollywood celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan have been vocal in their support of the game and often harp about its health benefits.

Revive our tradition through these games and make this weekend fun by learning how to play them. Flip through the pages of this ClipBook for more details.
