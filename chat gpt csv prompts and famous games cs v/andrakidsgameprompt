The other players, who usually number about 5 to 10, hide. The first player should find all the hidden players who would hide somewhere near. If any of the other players hit the first player on his or her back by saying "deef" with palm of a hand without being spotted then the first player should restart the game . If the first player spots any other player without the other playing saying deef as above, then the other player is out. The objective of the game is for the first player to find all hidden players without him/her restarting the game. The game is repeated with every player playing as the first player.[1]

Kabaddi (sometimes transliterated Kabbadi or Kabadi; (Telugu: కబడ్దీ) is a South Asian team sport.

Two teams occupy opposite halves of a small field and take turns sending a "raider" into the other half, in order to win points by tackling members of the opposing team; then the raider tries to return to their own half, holding their breath and chanting the word "Kabaddi" during the whole raid. The raider must not cross the lobby unless he touches any of their opponents. If he does so then he will be declared as "out". There is also a bonus line which ensures extra points for the raider if he manages to touch the lobby and return to their side of the field successfully.
