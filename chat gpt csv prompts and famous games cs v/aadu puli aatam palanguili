A fish shaped pallankuli board
Pallanguli,[1] or Pallankuli[2][3] (Tamil: பல்லாங்குழி, romanized: Pallāṅkuḻi, Malayalam: പല്ലാങ്കുഴി, romanized: Pallāṅkuḻi, Kannada: ಅಳಗುಳಿ ಮನೆ, romanized: Alaguli Mane, Telugu: వామన గుంటలు, romanized: Vamana guntalu, Marathi: सत्कोलि, romanized: Satkoli),[4] is a traditional ancient mancala game played in South India, especially Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This game was later introduced to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in India, as well as Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is played by two players, with a wooden board that has fourteen pits in all (hence, it is also called fourteen pits, or pathinālam kuḻi. There have been several variations in the layout of the pits, one among them being seven pits on each player's side. The pits contain cowry shells, seeds or small pebbles used as counters.[5] There are several variations of the game depending on the number of shells each player starts with.[6]

Gameplay
Overview

Girls playing Pallankuli
Pallankuli is played on a rectangular board with 2 rows and 7 columns. There are a total of 14 cups (kuḻi in Tamil) and 146 counters. For the counters in the game, seeds, shells, small stones are all common for use.[7] As the game proceeds, each player distributes the shells over all the pits. The players may capture the shells, as permitted by the rules of the game. The rules of capture depend on the variant of the game played. The game ends when one of the players captures all the shells, and is declared as a winner.

12 counters are placed in each cup except the middle of each row into which only 2 counters are placed. The starting player lifts the counters from any of his holes and, going counter-clockwise, distributes one counter in each hole. If he reaches the end of his cups he goes on his opponent's side of the board. When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction.

If, after having a counter dropped into it, a cup contains 6 counters, those become the property of the player who dropped the counter (pasu in Tamil) . The round is over when no counters remain.

Once the first round is over players take the counters from their stores and fill as many of their holes as possible with counters. The winner will have a surplus of counters which are kept in his store. The loser of the first round will be unable to fill all of his holes. These unfilled holes are marked as "rubbish holes." In the next round play continues as before, but without the rubbish holes being included and the player who went first in the previous round going second.

During the game if a player has enough counters to fill any of his rubbish holes back up their status is removed and they are again used during play. The game is over when a player is unable to fill any cups with six counters at the end of a round.

Objects
Tamarind seeds and cowry shells (Soḻi (சோழி) in Tamil) are used in this game, to fill the holes of the Alli gulli board.[8]

Popularity
This game is popular among the older generations of people. This game is also encouraged for the kids to learn to count, to improve eye–hand coordination and concentration while playing. Older people of the house play this game as a pastime with the young members of their family.[9]

Pallankuli is also played in Sri Lanka, Trinidad, Guyana and Singapore, with a sizable Tamil-Indian population living in those countries.

Ancient Tamils, during their Chola expedition, and trade with the islands of the Philippines, Sumatra and Java, introduced this game to Indonesia and the Philippines. In Indonesia, this is known as Congkak or Congklakin, and in the Philippines, it is known as sungkâ.

Aadu Puli Attam

                                                                                A Game Simple yet intellectual! 



Introduction: 

It is a traditional board game which few parents and some grandparents will remember. Every aspect of our culture is focused on making us a better person, both physically and mentally, and help us to face life with clarity. Aadu Puli Aattam is a board game which we must teach our children. Let us help our children understand and shift from violence-filled online games & play stations to traditional, enriching, and beneficial games such as Aadu puli Aattam. 



What do you need? 

The board consists of a big triangle divided by two lines starting from the higher end reaching two equidistant points at the lower end of the triangle. It is also divided by a quadrilateral in the middle. It looks like the picture given below, 

 

The game can be played with or without a game board. In the latter case, a triangle and a quadrilateral are usually drawn with the equidistant points in the mud floor. It is a two-player mind game which needs patience, keen observation, and calculations. Two sets of unique coins consisting of 3 tigers (puli) and 15 goats (aadu) are provided.  



How do you play? 

The Aadu Puli Attam starts with the one tiger in the apex and other two placed in the boxes next to the apex. The important rule is, that the coins should move and placed only at the intersection point of the columns, it should neither move in nor out. The Aadu Puli Attam begins once the goat in placed onto a free intersection on the board.  

The game becomes more inserting when all the 15 goats are inside the columns and start moving. Tiger can jump on to any goat and can capture it by moving to an adjacent free position. The moves should be valid ones. The goats can move only when all the 15 of them are inside the columns, until then they must stay still. 

Tigers can capture the goats anytime, but only moving on the adjacent column. A Tiger can capture one goat at a time, not more than that. A tiger should not jump over another tiger. Goats can encircle the tiger and block it from moving. Each tiger’s aim is to kill five goats. The victory is based on whether the tiger eats up all the goats or the goats block the tigers from moving. 



Conclusion: 

This game is played to sharpen the thinking power and to develop strategy-making. Through this game, the players are thought the importance of teamwork, how united and well guided goats can pass the movement of powerful tigers. This game is played mostly by men. In ancient house, we can see the engravings of this game chart in every Verandah.
